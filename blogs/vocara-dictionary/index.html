                <h4>Introduction to Vocara Dictionary</h4>
                <p>
                    Vocara Dictionary is a free to use online Dictionary with over 100,000+ words.
                    It is a multilingual dictionary which supports multilingual translation of words, definitions, synonyms, antonyms with audio support.
                    Every weeks Vocara Dictionary is added with 100-1,000 words to keep it updated with new words and meanings.
                </p>
                <h4>How Does it work?</h4>
                <p>
                    Vocara Dictionary suggest users with the words which are most used or searched to help user with easier to use UI.
                    After you enter the word the backend searches for the word if it is in the dictionary the data is returned (a json file containing translation, definitions, synonyms, antonyms, audio, etc).
                    If the word does not match with the word in dictionary like 'appl' which can be 'apple' or 'apply' it returns the most close word here example data of 'apple' is returned (if apple has greater search count).
                    In some cases the word might be completely out of dictionary so it would return empty data. It is a rare case. It can happen when the word doesn't actually exist like 'askdjau' which is just random letters.
                </p>
                <h4>Can I help in data creation?</h4>

                    If we approve it we will pay you the a good amount for your dataset.
